# Codsoft Data Science Internship Project Repository

Welcome to the Codsoft Data Science Internship Project Repository! This repository showcases the data analysis and machine learning projects completed during my internship at Codsoft.

## Overview

This repository contains several projects that demonstrate my skills and experience in data science. Each project folder typically includes:

- **Jupyter Notebooks**: Python code for data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), modeling, and evaluation.
- **Datasets**: Relevant datasets used for analysis and modeling.
- **Documentation**: Additional documents such as project proposals, reports, or presentations.

## Projects

### Task_1: TITANIC SURVIVAL PREDICTION

- **Objective**:Predicting survival outcomes for Titanic passengers using machine learning to analyze factors like age, gender, and class.
- **Methods**: Employing machine learning algorithms to predict Titanic passenger survival based on demographic and socio-economic features.
- **Results**: Achieved 89% accuracy in predicting customer churn.

### Task_2: Iris Flower Classification

- **Objective**:To create a robust machine learning model for accurately classifying iris flowers based on their sepal and petal measurements.
- **Methods**: Utilizing supervised learning algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, and KNN to classify iris flowers based on sepal and petal measurements.
- **Results**: ***logistic regression : accuracy for traning data is 0.9333333333333333
                        accuracy for test data is 0.8888888888888888 .
       decision trees      : accuracy for training data is 1.0
                        accuracy for test data is 0.8888888888888888.
  KNN                 : accuracy for training data is 1.0
                          accuracy for test data is 1.0***
