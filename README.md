# Codsoft Data Science Internship Project Repository

Welcome to the Codsoft Data Science Internship Project Repository! This repository showcases the data analysis and machine learning projects completed during my internship at Codsoft.

## Overview

This repository contains several projects that demonstrate my skills and experience in data science. Each project folder typically includes:

- **Jupyter Notebooks**: Python code for data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), modeling, and evaluation.
- **Datasets**: Relevant datasets used for analysis and modeling.
- **Documentation**: Additional documents such as project proposals, reports, or presentations.

## Projects

### Project 1: TITANIC SURVIVAL PREDICTION

- **Objective**: Predict customer churn to reduce customer attrition rates.
- **Methods**: Used classification algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest) and feature engineering.
- **Results**: Achieved 85% accuracy in predicting customer churn.
- **Data Source**: [Project 1]('https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/titanic-dataset')

### Project 2: Sales Forecasting

- **Objective**: Forecast future sales based on historical data.
- **Methods**: Time series analysis and forecasting techniques (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet).
- **Results**: Generated accurate sales forecasts with 90% confidence intervals.
- **Folder**: [Project 2 Folder](./Project2)
