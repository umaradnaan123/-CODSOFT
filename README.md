# Codsoft Data Science Internship Project Repository

Welcome to the Codsoft Data Science Internship Project Repository! This repository showcases the data analysis and machine learning projects completed during my internship at Codsoft.

## Overview

This repository contains several projects that demonstrate my skills and experience in data science. Each project folder typically includes:

- **Jupyter Notebooks**: Python code for data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), modeling, and evaluation.
- **Datasets**: Relevant datasets used for analysis and modeling.
- **Documentation**: Additional documents such as project proposals, reports, or presentations.

## Projects

### Project 1: TITANIC SURVIVAL PREDICTION

- **Objective**:Predicting survival outcomes for Titanic passengers using machine learning to analyze factors like age, gender, and class.
- **Methods**: Employing machine learning algorithms to predict Titanic passenger survival based on demographic and socio-economic features.
- **Results**: Achieved 89% accuracy in predicting customer churn.
